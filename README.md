# C++ Basics for VEXcode text

This will be a crash course into C++ basics so that you can get started in VEXcode Text. 
Some aspects of C++ will be skipped as I do not think they are relevant to get started in VEXcode text.
This crash course will make use of public/free videos with a variety of corresponding assignments.

Above are a couple of PDF files named Section1ProblemSet, Section2ProblemSet, and Section3ProblemSet. As the name of each of these files implies, each PDF holds a bunch of short programming problems that involve topics relating to the specified section. For example, Section1ProblemSet will have short problems relating to topics in Section 1, which include variables, input and output, and arithmetic. You will also see a set of folders named Section1Solutions, Section2Solutions, and Section3Solutions. These folders hold the answer code for each individual problem. The solution included for each problem is just one of many solutions, meaning it is possible for your program to look different from the solution and still work properly. In the course below, I will specify which short problems you have to complete for each section. Problems not listed down below that are in a problem set PDF are there for extra practice. There will be video walkthroughs for some of these listed problems in case you have no clue where to get started.

Click [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckbfOdMhZls&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lmGC8VW0iu6qfMHjy7gLQ3&index=2) to get a basic understanding of the programming stucture in C++.

After you have watched both of these videos, continue with the course down below, following the order from top to bottom. Do not just watch, but program along with the videos as much as possible.

## Problems to Complete from Section4ProblemSet

** Videos NOT OUT yet **

I strongly recommend that you solve each problem included in the Section4ProblemSet PDF. The last two problems, which deal with inheritance, cover a topic I have not covered yet. To tackle these problems, please locate the corresponding videos on my YouTube channel. Additionally, please note that the Section4ProblemSet does not provide a solution folder. Therefore, you will need to find the videos that match those specific questions to obtain a solution.
