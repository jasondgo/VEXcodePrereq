# C++ Basics for VEXcode text

This will be a crash course into C++ basics so that you can get started in VEXcode Text. 
Some aspects of C++ will be skipped as I do not think they are relevant to get started in VEXcode text.
This crash course will make use of public/free videos with a variety of corresponding assignments.

Click [HERE]() to get started installing the C++ extension to VScode. 

Click [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckbfOdMhZls&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lmGC8VW0iu6qfMHjy7gLQ3&index=2) to get a basic understanding of the programming stucture in C++.

After you have watched both of these videos, continue with the course down below, following the order from top to bottom. Do not just watch, but program along with the videos as much as possible.
