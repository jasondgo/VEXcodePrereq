Use cin to take user input when necessary.


1. Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements. `Cout` whether the number is positive, negative, or zero


2. Write a program that determines if a given number is even or odd using if-else statements. `Cout` whether the number is even or odd. ( Hint: Use Modulo )


3. Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and a given number using a while loop. `Cout` the final sum.


4. Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop. `Cout` the final sum of the factorial.


5. Write a program that finds the largest of three numbers using if-else statements. `Cout` the largest number.


6. Write a program that checks if a given year (above 400) is a leap year using if-else statements. `Cout` whether it is a leap year or not.


7.  Write a program that prints all the prime numbers between 1 and a given number using a while loop. 


8. Write a program that prints the Fibonacci series up to a given number using a while loop.


9.  Write a program that checks if a given number is a perfect square using if-else statements. `Cout` whether it is a perfect square or not. 


10. Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 and 5 between 1 and a given number using a while loop. `Cout` the sum of the numbers.


11. Write a program that determines the grade of a student based on their score using if-else statements. For example, if grade is above a 90 give an A, greater than 80 give B so on and so forth. `Cout` the grade.


12. Write a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number using a while loop. `Cout` the sum.


13.  Write a program that checks if a given number is a prime number using if-else statements. `Cout` is the prime number. 


14. Write a program that checks if a given number is a palindrome using a while loop and if-else statements. `Cout` whether it is a palindrome or not.


15.  Write a program that calculates the sum of all prime numbers between 1 and a given number using a while loop. `Cout` the sum.


16. Write a program that prints the right triangle shape out of asterisks. Right triangle must have a base width of 5 stars.


Ex.        *
              **
              ***
              ****
              *****
      


17. Write a program to calculate the total expenses. Quantity and price per item are input by the user and a discount of 10% is offered if the expense is more than 5000. `Cout        ` the final total.


18. Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are entered by the user. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees. `Cout` whether the triangle is valid or not.


19. Write a program to find the roots of and quadratic equation of type ax2+bx+c where a is not equal to zero. You will need to distinguish whether the roots are real & equal, real & distinct, or the roots are imaginary. `Cout` the roots and which classification they fall into.


20. Write a program to reverse any given integer number. `Cout` the reversed number.


21. Write a program to print out all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 500. If the sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, then the number is called an Armstrong number. For example, 153 = ( 1 * 1 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 5 * 5 ) + ( 3 * 3 * 3 )


22. Write a program to calculate GCF of Two given numbers. `Cout` the GCF. (Hint: Use the Euclidean Algorithm)


23. Print out the following patterns using a while loop.
